# features
- takes a simple 5-way switch and makes it mountable.
 - Mk17 used cheapie 5-ways and the play they have is terrible.
 - I made another breakout for an RKJXT but it requires quite a lot of force to actuate.
 - The Alps SKRHACE010 has low force and low play - but is SMD, so I had to get it assembled.

- pigtail pins

Very simple design, meant to nestle into a tight spot.
